# CANPi Server

Welcome to CANPi Server project.

The MERG-CANPi Server is an application that is designed to run on a RaspberryPi attached to a CAN module transceiver.
The app interfaces the MERG-CANBUS protocol and the JMRI Engine Drive application. 
It allows the user to drive model rail locomotives using the Engine Drive without JMRI.
The app also works as a CAN to CANGrid formatter via a tcp connection.
